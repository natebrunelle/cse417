# Homework

**Important:** Before starting your homework, please review our [homework guide](./guides.html#guide-to-homework) for requirements and suggestions!

Information will be posted here when Homework 1 is released.

## HW 0: Sample

To help you see what we expect good solutions to look like, provided below are the sample solutions to a sample problem. In particular, you can view the LaTeX source to get started learning how to write in LaTeX, and you can watch a video option to see how you should record a video if you so choose.

* [Problem statement/written solution](.files/homework/sample/sample.pdf)
* [LaTeX source](./files/homework/sample/sample.zip)
* [Video solution](.files/homework/sample/sample.mp4)

To use the LaTeX source, we recommend uploading the .zip file to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), and using its online compiler to compile and edit the file `sample.tex`. 

<!-- ## HW 1: Intro/<wbr>Correctness

**Quick links:**

- [Problem statements](./files/homework/hw1/hw1.pdf)
- [LaTeX template](./files/homework/hw1/hw1.zip)
- [Problem 1 extension 1 programming spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSTTKuxOrmNvc4y8pgdwg15vP1qehJP0ykoVPUVYyFGDE-SIvcvoHfNXFa8c3n2_61EHHudH5Bs85Bq/pub)

In the homework you will be asked to:

1. Reason with the definition of a stable matching.
1. Reflect on the use of LLMs for reasoning.
1. Prove a simple algorithm to be correct.

**Please read the instructions in the problem statements PDF.** Happy problem solving! -->


# Assessments
Information will be posted here closer to the day of Quiz 1.

<!-- Your midterm exam will be at 6:00pm-7:30pm on Wednesday February 19 in [Bagly 131](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/BAG) in lieue of a normal class meeting.

You will be permitted 1 letter-sized page, front and back, of notes to reference for the exam. You are welcome to construct that independently or in groups. You may type it or hand-write it. Besides this one page, the exam will otherwise be closed resources (i.e. no textbook, electronics, neighbors, etc.). The exam will additionally have some information provided for you (see what will be included by looking at the practice exam below). It's wortwhile to keep in mind what we include there when designing your personal notes sheet.


The midterm will cover all material from the beginning of the quarter through Dynamic Programming (i.e. everything through Homework 5). This includes all of:

- Stable Matching
- Graph Algorithms and aymptotic analysis
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms.

To give you a sense for what to expect, here are some practice exams for you:

- [practice exam 1](files/exams/practice-midterm-1.pdf) ([solutions](files/exams/practice-midterm-1-solutions.pdf))
- [practice exam 2](files/exams/practice-midterm-2.pdf) ([solutions](files/exams/practice-midterm-2-solutions.pdf))

We will additionally have a review session at 4:30pm on Tuesday February 18 in Bagly 131 (i.e. the exam room). During that review session we will discuss practice exam 1. There will be additional review in your regular section on 2/13. Office hours are also certainly a resource for preparing for the exam (Nathan will hold some on Tuesday 2/18 since 2/17 is a holiday). -->

<!-- ## Final
Your final exam will occur at 2:30pm on Monday March 17. Because the course scheduled into the final exam block after ours does not have a final exam, you will have until 5:20pm to take the exam. Again, if you have anticipated conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle.

You will be permitted 1 letter-sized page, front and back, of notes to reference for the exam. You are welcome to construct that independently or in groups. You may type it or hand-write it. Besides this one page, the exam will otherwise be closed resources (i.e. no textbook, electronics, neighbors, etc.). The exam will additionally have some information provided for you (see what will be included by looking at the practice exam below). It's wortwhile to keep in mind what we include there when designing your personal notes sheet.

The exam is cumulative, and so may include any topic from the entire quarter. In particular, this means all midterm content as well as:

- Max flow, min cut, and applications thereof
- Linear Programming
- NP Completeness

Expect the exam to contain roughly 8 short answer questions and roughly 4 long-form questions (the exact numbers will depend on the diffucly level of the specific questions selected). We have provided a sample exam below. Note that this sample exam is actually slightly longer than the actual final will be (it has 10 short answer and 6 long-form questions). We provided more questions in the practice in order to demonstrate a broader variety of questions you might see on the actual exam.

[practice final](files/exams/practice-final.pdf) ([solutions](files/exams/practice-final-solutions.pdf))

We will discuss this practice exam during a review session on Friday 3/14 4:30pm-6:30pm in CSE2 room G20. -->
