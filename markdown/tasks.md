# Homework

**Important:** Before starting your homework, please review our [homework guide](./guides.html#guide-to-homework) for requirements and suggestions!


## HW 0: Sample

To help you see what we expect good solutions to look like, provided below are the sample solutions to a sample problem. In particular, you can view the LaTeX source to get started learning how to write in LaTeX, and you can watch a video option to see how you should record a video if you so choose.

* [Problem statement/written solution](files/homework/sample/sample.pdf)
* [LaTeX source](files/homework/sample/sample.zip)
* [Video solution](files/homework/sample/sample.mp4)

To use the LaTeX source, we recommend uploading the .zip file to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), and using its online compiler to compile and edit the file `sample.tex`.

# Quizzes

We will have 2 quizzes this quarter, which will be held in class on the following dates. We will allocate the full 50 minute lecture period for the quiz.

1. Friday 10/24
1. Friday 11/21

You will be permitted to bring 1 letter-sized page, front and back, of notes *of your own creation* to reference. You are welcome to collaborate on the construction, but there are well-supported studies that suggest a lot of learning happens during the construction of that notes page, so we strongly suggest that you actively participate in building it. You may type it or hand-write it. 

Besides this one page, we will also provide you a reference sheet with the quiz. The quiz will otherwise be closed resources (i.e. no textbook, electronics, neighbors, etc.).



# Quiz 1

Quiz 1 (on 10/24) will cover all material from the beginning of the quarter through Divide and Conquer (i.e. Homeworks 1,2, and 3). This includes all of:

- Stable Matching
- Algorithm correctness
- Running time and asymptotic analysis
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Here's a [link to the quiz reference sheet](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/25au/files/quizzes/q1reference.pdf).

To give you a sense for what to expect, we have provided a practice quiz. This practice quiz is intended to be representative of what we believe would be a reasonable quiz, but is not necessarily going to resemble *your* quiz. We recommend using this quiz as a tool to self-evaluated your preparedness after studying, rather than as a guide on what to study.

- [Practice quiz 1](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/25au/files/quizzes/practicequiz1_au25.pdf) and [solutions](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/25au/files/quizzes/practicequiz1_au25_sols.pdf)

We will additionally have a quiz review in the lecture prior to the quiz (so Wednesday 10/22). 


## Quiz 2

Quiz 2 (on 11/21) will cover all material from the end of quiz 1 content through Greedy Algorithms (i.e. Homeworks 4,5, and 6). This includes all of:

- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms

As with Quiz 1, we will provide a reference sheet for Quiz 2, and you are additionally welcome to bring a 1-page (front and back) reference sheet of your own to the quiz. We will release the reference sheet that we will provide plus a practice quiz approximately 1 week in advance of Quiz 2.

We will additionally have a quiz review in the lecture prior to the quiz (so Wednesday 11/19).

<!-- 
## Final
Your final exam will occur at 2:30pm on Monday March 17. Because the course scheduled into the final exam block after ours does not have a final exam, you will have until 5:20pm to take the exam. Again, if you have anticipated conflicts with this time, please let Prof. Brunelle.

You will be permitted 1 letter-sized page, front and back, of notes to reference for the exam. You are welcome to construct that independently or in groups. You may type it or hand-write it. Besides this one page, the exam will otherwise be closed resources (i.e. no textbook, electronics, neighbors, etc.). The exam will additionally have some information provided for you (see what will be included by looking at the practice exam below). It's wortwhile to keep in mind what we include there when designing your personal notes sheet.

The exam is cumulative, and so may include any topic from the entire quarter. In particular, this means all midterm content as well as:

- Max flow, min cut, and applications thereof
- Linear Programming
- NP Completeness

Expect the exam to contain roughly 8 short answer questions and roughly 4 long-form questions (the exact numbers will depend on the diffucly level of the specific questions selected). We have provided a sample exam below. Note that this sample exam is actually slightly longer than the actual final will be (it has 10 short answer and 6 long-form questions). We provided more questions in the practice in order to demonstrate a broader variety of questions you might see on the actual exam.

[practice final](files/exams/practice-final.pdf) ([solutions](files/exams/practice-final-solutions.pdf))

We will discuss this practice exam during a review session on Friday 3/14 4:30pm-6:30pm in CSE2 room G20. -->
