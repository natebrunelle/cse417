Hello y’all, my name is Zachary and I am a current junior. I am a big advocate for LeetCode and procrastination. In my free time I like to procrastinate and do LeetCode problems. I was originally pre: science (statistics intended) but switched into studying computer science, so feel free to reach out to me about that. I hope y’all have a great quarter and I look forward to meeting you all.
