# Welcome to CSE 417 (Autumn 2025)

**Official Course Title:** Algorithms and Computational Complexity

**Primary Instructors:** Nathan Brunelle and Glenn Sun

## Course Goals

CSE 417 is an introduction to algorithms. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Discuss how and why certain foundational algorithms work.
- Design algorithms for new problems using a variety of algorithm-design paradigms.
- Mathematically prove that your algorithm produces the correct answer.
- Model word problems computationally and consider the implications of modeling decisions in the real world.

## Eligibility

You should take this course only if

1. You have credit for CSE 373 or equivalent
1. You are NOT a CSE major

# Tips for success in this course

In this course, you will learn some particular noteworthy and widely-used algorithms, as well as learn and apply techniques to develop your own algorithms to solve new problems. This will be at times uncomfortable and frustrating, so we have a few suggestions for how to navigate this:

1. **If something is not clear, ask.** In lecture, other people probably have the same question. On homework and exams, our intent is never to ask trick questions, so ask on Ed for clarification.
1. **Reason carefully and precisely.** Although we won't purposefully mislead you, we may ask questions that are designed to expose flawed intuition or a common misconception. Reason step-by-step, and avoid "intuitive" statements that are actually logical leaps.
1. **Use techniques from lecture in your homework.** Homework problems will always use techniques recently covered in lecture. Also note that most homework will be about reinforcing *techniques* from lecture, *not* specific algorithms or examples.
