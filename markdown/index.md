# Course Description

## Course Goals

CSE 417 is an introduction to algorithms. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Discuss how and why certain foundational algorithms work.
- Design algorithms for new problems using a variety of algorithm-design paradigms.
- Mathematically prove that your algorithm produces the correct answer.
- Model word problems computationally and consider the implications of modeling decisions in the real world.

## Eligibility

You should take this course only if

1. You have credit for CSE 373 or equivalent
1. You are NOT a CSE major

# What to expect in this course

In this course, you will learn some particular noteworthy and widely-used algorithms, as well as learn and apply techniques to develop your own algorithm to solve new problems. Both of these are important, and we will discuss both in detail throughout the course. 

At the same time, since developing a skill often requires more effort than understanding prior work of others, most of your homework will be about solving new problems. This will be at times uncomfortable, occasionally frustrating, but hopefully always fun and valuable in retrospect. We have a few guidelines/suggestions for how you can get the most out of this course:

1. **If something is not clear, ask.** You are likely not the only person for which it is not clear. In lecture, asking questions helps the instructor pace the class appropriately. On homework and exams, we will never ask trick questions that are intended to mislead you. If you need clarification, we will always be happy to help you.
1. **Reason carefully and precisely.** While we will not purposefully mislead you, we may ask questions that are specifically designed to expose and correct a flawed intuition or common misconception. You can sometimes let intuition guide your overall thought process, but you must always write your reasoning step-by-step to avoid mistakes. 
1. **Use techniques from lecture in your homework.** The techniques covered in lecture should be used to solve the homework problems for that week, which help you get started more easily. Note that most homework will be about reinforcing techniques from lecture, *not* specific algorithms and examples discussed.



# What to expect in office hours

Instructor and TA office hours will be available to assist you in understanding course concepts and applying those concepts to your assignments. Office hours should never be used as a substitute for your own learning or for your own earnest effort. As such, the amount of assistance the course staff will provide should correlate with the amount of progress you've made and understanding you possess. In short, the more work you've done and the more understanding you have demonstrated before arriving to office hours, the more precise the help we will provide. If you're just beginning to solve the problem or are missing some concept then the help given will be more conceptual in nature.

Our TAs are critical to the operation of this this course, and are responsible for a number of activities (office hours, grading, staff meetings, leading section, personal prep, etc.). Because of this variety of tasks they are involved in, office hours is a limited resource. As such, we ave some expectations in place designed to most equitably provide office hours to students in the course:

-  When there is a queue in office hours, we will limit each student-TA interaction to addressing just a *single* question. To ask multiple questions you will need to re-enter the queue. The reason for this policy is to help as many students as quickly as possible, since after a first round of assistance you will have an opportunity to make more progress on your own before your turn comes up again. I recommend arriving prepared with the question that is your biggest "blocker" to progress.
- The questions we answer must be precise and concept-related. We will not acquiesce requests for hints or other such open-ended questions. If you are "stuck" and unsure of how to proceed, you might instead share what progress you've made, what you're stuck on, and then ask a question related to a potential next step.
- We will also not be able to verify answers in office hours. If you are uncertain of an answer then I would recommend asking a related question. For example, you could perhaps consider some consequence of your solution and ask about that. 
- For clarification questions or high-level conceptual questions, consider using the Ed Message Board first. Your question may already be answered there, and even if not then you may get an answer faster compared to going to office hours. If what you ask is something that would be more effective to discuss in office hours, we'll let you know that, too!
